# AgentMarkdown

An accurate, extensible, and fast HTML-to-markdown converter.

AgentMarkdown is a [HTML user agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent) that parses HTML, performs a document layout according to the [CSS stylesheet for HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#the-css-user-agent-style-sheet-and-presentational-hints) and then "renders" the laid out document to Markdown. This results in markdown that looks very similar to the way the HTML document looked when parsed and rendered in a browser (user agent).

# Building

The package is written in TypeScript. To build the package run the following from the root of the repo:

    yarn build # It will be built in /dist

## Release Process (Deploying to NPM) üöÄ

This project uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to automates the whole package release workflow including: determining the next version number, generating the release notes and publishing the package. For each new commits added to the release branch (i.e. `master`) with `git push` or by merging a pull request or merging from another branch, a CI build is triggered and runs the `semantic-release` command to make a release if there are codebase changes since the last release that affect the package functionalities.
