# Agent Markdown

An accurate, extensible, and fast HTML-to-markdown converter.

Agent Markdown is a [HTML user agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent) that parses HTML, performs a document layout according to the [CSS stylesheet for HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#the-css-user-agent-style-sheet-and-presentational-hints) and then "renders" the laid out document to Markdown. This results in markdown that looks very similar to the way the HTML document looked when parsed and rendered in a browser (user agent).

## Usage / Quick Start

```
import { AgentMarkdown } from "agentmarkdown"
const markdownString = await AgentMarkdown.produce(htmlString)
```

## Install

yarn (`yarn add agentmarkdown`) or npm (`npm install agentmarkdown`)

## Features

- Accurately converts HTML to [CommonMark-compliant](https://commonmark.org/) markdown
  - uses [GitHub-Flavored Markdown's Strikethrough extention](https://github.github.com/gfm/#strikethrough-extension-) for &lt;strike&gt; and &lt;del&gt;.
- Supports even wonky technically incorrect HTML
- Supports nested lists
- Supports [implied paragraphs](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#paragraphs) / [CSS anonymous bock box layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/visuren.html#anonymous-block-level)
- Can be used client side (in the browser) or server side (with Node.js)
- Add support for new elements [with plugins](#customize--extend-with-plugins)
- Fast?

## CLI Example

You can convert any HTML file to Markdown at the command line using the following command, and the markdown output will be printed to stdout:

    agentmarkdown <filename.html>

It also responds to stdin, if you pipe html to it. So you can do things like:

    echo "<b>bold</bold>" | agentmarkdown > myfile.md

The above commands assume you installed agentmarkdown with `yarn global add agentmarkdown`, `npm install --global agentmarkdown` but it also works with `npx` so you can run it without installing like:

    npx agentmarkdown <filename.html>

## Live Example

You can view the live online web example at [https://agentmarkdown.now.sh](https://agentmarkdown.now.sh).

You can build and the web example locally with the following commands:

```
cd example/
yarn
yarn start
```

## Customize & Extend with Plugins

To customize how the markdown is generated or add support for new elements, implement the `LayoutPlugin` interface to handle a particular HTML element. The `LayoutPlugin` interface is defined as follows:

```TypeScript
export interface LayoutPlugin {
  /**
   * Specifies the name of the HTML element that this plugin renders markdown for.
   * NOTE: Must be all lowercase
   */
  elementName: string
  /**
   * This is the core of the implementation that will be called for each instance of the HTML element that this plugin is registered for.
   */
  layout: LayoutGenerator
}
```

The `LayoutGenerator` is a single function that performs a [CSS2 box generation layout algorithm](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/visuren.html#box-gen) on the an HTML element. Essentially it creates zero or more boxes for the given element that AgentMarkdown will render to text. A box can contain text content and/or other boxes, and each box has a type of `inline` or `block`. Inline blocks are laid out horizontally. Block boxes are laid out vertically (i.e. they have new line characters before and after their contents). The `LayoutGenerator` function definition is as follows:

```TypeScript
export interface LayoutGenerator {
  (
    context: LayoutContext,
    manager: LayoutManager,
    element: HtmlNode
  ): CssBox | null
}
```

An example of how the HTML `<b>` element could be implemented as a plugin like the following:

```TypeScript
class BoldPlugin {
  elementName: "b"

  layout: LayoutGenerator = (
    context: LayoutContext,
    manager: LayoutManager,
    element: HtmlNode
  ): CssBox | null => {
    // let the manager use other plugins to layout any child elements:
    const kids = manager.layout(context, element.children)
    // wrap the child elements in the markdown ** syntax for bold/strong:
    kids.unshift(manager.createBox(BoxType.inline, "**"))
    kids.push(manager.createBox(BoxType.inline, "**"))
    // return a new box containing everything:
    return manager.createBox(BoxType.inline, "", kids)
  }
}
```

To initialize AgentMarkdown with plugins pass them in as an array value for the `layoutPlugins` option as follows. To customize the rendering an element you can just specify a plugin for the elementName and your plugin will override the built-in plugin.

```TypeScript
const result = await AgentMarkdown.render({
    html: myHtmlString,
    layoutPlugins: [
      new BoldPlugin()
    ]
  })
```

## Release Process (Deploying to NPM) üöÄ

We use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to consistently release [semver](https://semver.org/)-compatible versions. This project deploys to multiple [npm distribution tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag). Each of the below branches correspond to the following npm distribution tags:

| branch | npm distribution tag |
| ------ | -------------------- |
| master | latest               |
| beta   | beta                 |

To trigger a release use a Conventional Commit following [Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines) on one of the above branches.
