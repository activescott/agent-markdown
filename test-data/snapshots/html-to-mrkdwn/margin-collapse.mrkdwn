<!--
This is all about margins and collapsing margins in particular: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/box.html#margin-properties
This one demonstrates the collapsed margin between the two paragraphs. Specifically:
1. There is a line between the two paragraphs
2. There is only one line, rather than two (one for the bottom margin of paragraph a, and one for the top margin of paragraph b).
