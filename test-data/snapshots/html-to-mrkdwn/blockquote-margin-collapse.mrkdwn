This is very similar to `margin-collapse.mrkdwn` except this one is demonstrating the impact it has on the containing blockquote box. 
Blockquote is one of the few containers where we actually acknowledge styling like borders since blockquote's left "border" has to render in markdown too.

It demonstrates the collapsed margin between the two paragraphs. Specifically:
1. There is a line between the two paragraphs AND the blockquote is kept to a single blockquote rather than two separate ones.
2. There is only one line between each, rather than two (one for the bottom margin of paragraph a, and one for the top margin of paragraph b).
3. Also the blockquote has no blank lines above it or below it as the margin is collapsed into it's parent.
NOTE: CSS2 says that the root element's margins (i.e. the body's margins) cannot collapse with it's children in [8.3.1 Collapsing margins](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/box.html#collapsing-margins). However, this is odd in markdown to put a blank line at the beginning of the doc and the end so we /do/ collapse with a sort of "invisible margin" when rendering to markdown.
